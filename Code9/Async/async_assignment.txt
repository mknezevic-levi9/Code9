Add asynchronous overload of WebScrapper.GetPageContent() method. 
Method should be asynchronous (awaitable), and should use async overload of WebClient.DownloadStringTaskAsync(string url) overload.  

Demonstration should invoke async method, do some work in the foreground (Console.WriteLine() should be enough),
and task should be awaited and result written to console.
