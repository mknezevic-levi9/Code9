Modify Customer class so that class receives custom validation delegate (which is called internally in PerformCustomValidation() method).
Custom validation should consist of checking string properties for length (maximum length is 20),
and age should be in range (14 - 100).

Add ValidationCompletedDelegate delegate and event OnValidationCompleted which should be raised when custom validation is completed.

Add event handler for OnValidationCompleted in Program.Main which writes validation result to console.
